        "A European banking institute conducted a marketing campaign for 18 months between 2008 & 2010. The direct markteing was rendered through phone calls. The financial instrument offered during the marketing was term deposit. The bank has adopted advance analytics, Predictive Machine Learning, to learn about the customers who are receptive to subscribing to marketing campaign\n",

        "> *What is Term Deposit?*\\\n",
        "Term Deposits, popularly known as Fixed Deposit, is an investment instrument in which a lump-sum sum amount is deposited at an agreed rate of interest for a fixed period of time, ranging from 1 month to 5 years.\n",

        "\n",
        "A machine learning classification model can be used to predict the actual class of the data point directly or predict its probability of belonging to different classes. The latter gives us more control over the result. We can determine our own threshold to interpret the result of the classifier. This is sometimes more prudent than just building a completely new model.\\\n",
        "The predictions in the bank dataset are represented as probability of the instance to be positive (customer will subscribe to term deposit in the marketing campaign). \n",
        "\n",
        "In case we were to promote the current machine learning model for future campaign decisions, hypothetically, a stakeholder requirement could fall into the below two options: \n",
        "\n",
        "1.   From a marketing manager perspective, is the model correctly identifying customers who have subscribed to term deposits? The manager is interested in higher True Positive Rate as a performance metric since they want to gain higher conversion rate on these marketing activities.\n",
        "2.   From an operations manager perspective, is the model incorrectly identifying customers to have subscribed to term deposits, when they have'nt? The manager is interested in keeping low False Positive Rate as a performance metric since they want to optimally utilize the staff for marketing activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we dont have these stakeholders available to advise on specificity of the threshold for business purpose; we will use a metric called AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve that evaluates the model's performance at varied thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is the AUC - ROC Curve?\n",
        "AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1.By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between customers who will subscribe vs. not. \n",
        "How is this calculated? ROC curve plots TPR against FPR at various threshold values.\n",
        "1.   True Positive Rate (TPR) -  proportion of the customers who subscribed got correctly classified.\n",
        "2.   False Positive Rate (FPR) - proportion of the customer who didnt subscribe but got incorrectly classified.\\\n",
        "\\\n",
        "How do we read AUC?\n",
        "- When AUC = 1, then the classifier is able to perfectly distinguish between all the Positive and the Negative class points correctly.\n",
        "- When 0.5<AUC<1, there is a high chance that the classifier will be able to distinguish the positive class values from the negative class values.\n",
